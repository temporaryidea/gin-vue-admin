# Service/Example Files Analysis

## Files to Test
1. enter.go - Service group initialization
2. exa_breakpoint_continue.go - Breakpoint continuation service
3. exa_customer.go - Customer management service
4. exa_file_upload_download.go - File upload/download service

## Test Coverage Requirements
- Need to verify test patterns from existing tests
- Need to understand dependencies and interfaces
- Need to determine mock requirements

## Questions to Answer
1. What is the purpose and functionality of each service?
2. What are the existing test patterns/conventions?
3. What dependencies and interfaces are used?
4. What test coverage is expected?
5. Should mocks be used for external dependencies?

## Next Steps
1. Analyze existing test files for patterns
2. Document service dependencies
3. Plan test coverage approach
